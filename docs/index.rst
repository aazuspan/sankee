sankee
==================================

:code:`sankee` combines the power of `Earth Engine <https://github.com/google/earthengine-api>`_ and `Plotly <https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py>`_ to 
visualize changes in land cover, plant health, burn severity, or any other classified imagery over a time series in a region of interest using interactive 
Sankey plots. Use a library of built-in datasets like `NLCD <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/USGS_NLCD_RELEASES_2019_REL_NLCD?hl=en>`_, 
`MODIS Land Cover <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MCD12Q1>`_, or 
`CGLS <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global?hl=en>`_ for convenience or define your 
own custom datasets for flexibility.
